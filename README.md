Hi there 👋 

Thanks for checking out my github!

Somehow over the last few years I have stumbled from pizza delivery to Data Science @ Shopify.

Must have taken a wrong turn on my last delivery? 

But in all seriousness, I ended up here likely due to a deep curiousity for the business problems which I work on. Once I realized I needed SQL to be able to answer my curiosities I was absolutely hooked. My path with SQL led me to working as an analyst in Shopify's financial product realm where I helped find business opportunities for;

- Improving sales team processes
- Reporting on sales team wins
- Finding inconsistencies with our financial products (some inconsistencies led to millions of dollars of revenue being created)
- Developing data stories (I was a key contributor on developing the sales story for [Shop](https://shop.app/what-shop-does)

Beyond that I have worked across many parts of the company, and like to think I have had a huge impact on Shopify, as a result on entreprenuership, and even the environment (thanks to [Shop!](https://shop.app/carbon-offsetting).

I feel blessed to do the work I do everyday and am so excited about the field of Data Science. 

Currently I am based in: Kelowna, BC, Canada 🇨🇦

I absolutely love to travel ✈️

mainly to 🏄 🏂

A fun fact about me: I treeplanted for 4 years through university and planted over half a million trees 🌴
